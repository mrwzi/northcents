          NorthCents works without an account. Cloud backup is optional and only
          occurs when a signed-in user explicitly requests it.

        <h2>What is stored</h2>
        <p>
          Monthly baseline values are saved in local storage. Accounts and the
          financial workspace are saved in this browser&apos;s IndexedDB.
          Clearing browser data removes these local copies.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you create an account, Supabase processes your email and session.
          Financial workspace data is transmitted to Supabase only when you
          choose a cloud save or restore action in Settings. Database policies
          restrict workspace rows to their authenticated owner.
        </p>
        <h2>What is not stored</h2>
        <p>
          Demo selections are synthetic and are not saved into a personal cloud
          workspace. NorthCents never requests bank passwords, account numbers,
          transit numbers, card numbers, CVVs, or banking access tokens.
        </p>
        <h2>Deleting information</h2>
        <p>
          Local deletion and cloud deletion are separate. Browser controls
          remove on-device values. Signed-in users can delete their cloud
          financial workspaces from Settings.
