# NorthCents architecture

NorthCents separates financial rules from presentation and persistence. The UI
must call domain functions instead of recreating calculations inside React
components.

## Main boundaries

- `src/domain/` contains the frozen V1 monthly-baseline and scenario engine.
- `src/v2/domain/` contains framework-independent money, account, budget,
  calendar, recurrence, and workspace contracts.
- `src/v2/storage/` owns validated IndexedDB persistence, migration, and local
  export/import behavior.
- `src/v2/react/` adapts the local repository for React components.
- `src/components/` contains browser-facing workflows grouped by feature.
- `src/app/` contains Next.js routes and route-level composition.
- `tests/unit/`, `tests/components/`, and `tests/e2e/` verify the corresponding
  boundaries.

The domain layer never imports React, Next.js, browser storage, or Supabase.
Personal financial values reach Supabase only after the signed-in user selects
an explicit cloud backup or restore action.

## Money and dates

- Monetary truth is stored as integer CAD cents.
- Formatting belongs at the UI boundary.
- Calendar dates use validated `YYYY-MM-DD` values and domain calendar helpers.
- Financial date arithmetic must not use implicit JavaScript date parsing.

## Account feature

`src/components/accounts/` is split by responsibility:

- `AccountsManager.tsx` coordinates workspace changes and the account editor.
- `AccountRows.tsx` renders asset and liability rows.
- `QuickActivityDialog.tsx` owns the money-in and money-out form.
- `account-options.ts` contains user-facing labels and stable input choices.

All balance changes use `applyAssetAccountActivity` from the V2 domain. The UI
does not calculate balances independently.

## Planning feature

The planning UI creates editable category envelopes. It does not move money at
a bank. Suggested paycheque splits use the user's saved category proportions,
required debt information, and deterministic integer-cent rounding.

## Persistence sources

- IndexedDB is the authoritative on-device V2 workspace store.
- The original local-storage baseline remains for V1 compatibility.
- Supabase authentication and cloud workspace backup are optional.
- Demo profiles are synthetic and remain distinct from user-entered data.

## Change checklist

Before merging a change:

1. Keep formulas and validation in the domain layer.
2. Add or update the closest unit/component/browser test.
3. Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and
   `npm run format:check`.
4. Run `npm run build` for route, bundling, and production validation.
5. Run the relevant Playwright flow for user-facing changes.
