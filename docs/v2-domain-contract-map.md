# Monevero V2 Domain Contract Map

Status: Phase 1 contract freeze  
Date: 2026-09-23  
Implementation: none; this document defines framework-independent boundaries

## 1. Boundary rules

- Proposed V2 domain code will live under `src/domain/v2/` and have no React, Next.js, browser storage, network, or UI dependencies.
- Public functions accept validated immutable values and return new immutable values or typed errors. No module mutates inputs.
- CAD money is integer cents at persisted/public domain boundaries.
- Financial dates are canonical date-only strings, not JavaScript `Date` objects or UTC instants.
- Existing V1 domain modules remain frozen. Only the V1 adapter may depend on their types/functions as documented below.
- Components consume domain/application results; they never implement recurrence, money, projection, debt, budget, goal, or attention formulas.
- This contract map names proposed modules. It does not create their application code.

## 2. Shared domain vocabulary

```ts
type Cents = number; // safe integer CAD cents
type BasisPoints = number; // safe integer; 1999 = 19.99%
type LocalDate = string; // canonical YYYY-MM-DD, validated as a real date
type Instant = string; // canonical ISO 8601 UTC timestamp for audit metadata only
type EntityId = string; // opaque locally generated identifier
type Provenance = "synthetic-demo" | "user-entered";
type Commitment = "required" | "flexible" | "optional";
type Actuality = "expected" | "actual" | "cancelled";
```

`LocalDate` and `Instant` are intentionally different types. Financial scheduling uses `LocalDate`; `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `exportedAt`, and `retrievedAt` use `Instant`.

## 4. Frozen calendar-date contract

### 4.1 Canonical representation

`LocalDate` is a branded/validated string in exact ASCII `YYYY-MM-DD` form:

```text
2026-01-05  valid and canonical
2026-1-5    invalid
2026-02-29  invalid (2026 is not leap)
2028-02-29  valid
```

The supported year range will be a named constant selected during implementation and must cover all allowed financial horizons. Parsing performs syntactic validation and Gregorian calendar validation. Parsing never invokes `new Date("YYYY-MM-DD")`, `Date.parse`, locale parsing, or an implicit timezone.

### 4.2 Timezone independence and formatting

- Domain comparisons and arithmetic operate on year/month/day parts or a date-only library with equivalent semantics.
- Changing device timezone cannot change an event’s date or recurrence output.
- IANA workspace timezone is retained only for converting explicit instants (such as an imported transaction timestamp) into a date through an explicit conversion function.
- User display formatting receives a validated locale and `LocalDate`; it does not round-trip through an instant.
- Audit instants are UTC ISO strings and never substitute for financial dates.

### 4.3 Gregorian rules

- Leap year: divisible by 4, except century years not divisible by 400.
- February has 29 days only in a leap year.
- Month lengths are Gregorian 28/29/30/31.
- Adding calendar days crosses month/year boundaries without timezone/DST effects.
- `daysBetween(a, b)` counts midnight-free calendar boundaries and is antisymmetric; debt models must document whether start/end dates accrue interest.

### 4.4 Projection boundaries

Projection horizons are closed intervals `[startDate, endDate]`: events on both dates are included. `startDate` is the workspace as-of date unless explicitly provided. Opening available cash is measured at the start of `startDate`; completed events already reflected in that opening cash must not be included again.

“Before next income” means a due date strictly earlier than the next expected income date. Required events on the same date are reported in the same-day group/uncertainty rather than “before.” Month-end balance means closing balance on the last calendar day of the named month, using all included events through that date.

### 4.5 Recurrence semantics

**Weekly:** emit on ISO weekday 1 (Monday) through 7 (Sunday) at `intervalWeeks`; the first result is the first matching date on/after recurrence start.

**Biweekly:** emit every 14 calendar days from an explicit anchor occurrence. The anchor need not be inside the requested horizon. Do not approximate as twice monthly.

**Semimonthly:** two distinct ordered nominal days per calendar month, such as 15 and 31. It is not a 15-day interval. Each nominal day independently applies the month-end clamp. If both nominal days clamp to the same actual date (for example 30 and 31 in February), emit one occurrence and a `coalesced-occurrence` diagnostic rather than double charging silently. This coalescing behavior is the frozen contract and must be tested.

**Monthly:** a nominal day 1–31. If absent, clamp to the month’s final day. A recurrence anchored on January 31 therefore emits February 28/29, March 31, April 30; the nominal day remains 31 and is not changed to 28.

**Irregular:** no generated dates; explicit events only.

**One-time:** one validated date inside bounds.

Recurrence bounds and projection bounds are inclusive. Optional recurrence end date suppresses later occurrences. Expansion requires a finite horizon and maximum occurrence count.

### 4.6 Same-date grouping

All events with identical canonical date strings form one `DailyEventGroup`, regardless of input order. The group has stable event ordering only for presentation (for example label then ID); calculation uses sums and makes no posting-order claim.

```ts
type SameDayTimingUncertainty = Readonly<{
  date: LocalDate;
  relatedEventIds: readonly EntityId[];
  openingBalanceCents: Cents;
  includedInflowCents: Cents;
  includedOutflowCents: Cents;
  possibleLowBeforeInflowsCents: Cents;
  endOfDayBalanceCents: Cents;
  reason: "date-only-order-unknown";
}>;
```

Emit uncertainty when the group contains at least one inflow and one outflow and ordering changes whether available cash could fall below zero, or otherwise crosses a configured factual availability boundary. No event is assigned a hidden time.

## 5. Frozen money contract

### 5.1 Representation and limits

- Currency is CAD for V2.
- Persisted and public personal-money fields are signed or non-negative safe integer cents according to their semantic type.
- User-entered amounts generally require non-negative cents; calculated balances/differences may be negative.
- V1 keeps `MAX_MONTHLY_CENTS = 100_000_000` per input field unchanged.
- V2 uses an absolute single-value ceiling of 10,000,000,000 cents. Manual cash-account balances and their derived consolidated total are signed values within this ceiling. Every arithmetic operation checks `Number.isSafeInteger`; overflow returns a typed error.
- No UI component adds, subtracts, multiplies, divides, annualizes, accrues, or rounds money.

### 5.2 Arithmetic

- Addition/subtraction operates only on integer cents and checks the result.
- Summation starts at integer zero and checks each/aggregate result.
- Annualization of an invariant monthly amount is exact integer multiplication by 12. Dated annual totals instead sum actual events and are not called annualized monthly impact.
- Ratios are derived from unrounded integer totals. Zero denominator returns `null`, never Infinity/NaN.
- Percentage application calculates in a domain helper and rounds once at the output boundary.

### 5.3 Rounding

V1’s `roundHalfAwayFromZero` remains the default conversion from a fractional-cent result to cents. Display rounding never becomes calculation input. Exact-cent allocation uses quotient/remainder distribution rather than rounding each share independently:

```text
base = floor(total / count)
remainder = total mod count
first `remainder` stable recipients receive base + 1 cent
others receive base cents
```

Signed allocation, if later needed, distributes magnitude then reapplies sign under a separately tested helper.

### 5.4 Debt-interest intermediate precision

Debt inputs/outputs and posted schedule entries are integer cents. The future APR estimate may need precision below one cent between posting boundaries. It must use an exact rational or reviewed arbitrary-precision decimal representation—not binary floating-point dollars.

Conceptually:

```text
unpostedInterest = principalCents × aprBasisPoints × elapsedDays
                   / (10_000 × 365)
postedInterestCents = halfAwayFromZero(unpostedInterest)
```

The implementation retains the exact numerator/denominator or decimal equivalent until the declared monthly posting boundary, then rounds once to cents. It must not round daily interest to cents and sum those rounded values. Every result states `actual-365`, monthly posting, and half-away-from-zero posting rounding. Other methods require a new typed model.

### 5.5 Import/export

- JSON encodes money as integer cents, never formatted strings or decimal dollars.
- Every export declares CAD, export format version, and data schema version.
- Import rejects non-integers, unsafe integers, values outside the eventual named V2 limits, missing currency, and unsupported currencies.
- CSV transaction staging, when implemented, parses decimal text into cents at the local boundary before domain use.

## 6. Frozen normalized-event contract

  kind: FinancialEventKind;
  sourceEntityId: EntityId;

  actuality: Actuality;

  label: string;

}>;
```

### 6.1 Kind and direction rules

| Kind                       | Allowed direction | Default commitment                                                                                                           | Spendable-cash effect                                                       |

| `expense`                  | outflow           | source value: required/flexible/optional                                                                                     | decreases consolidated cash when included                                   |
| `debt-payment`             | outflow           | required for contractual minimum; flexible/optional for explicit additional payment                                          | decreases consolidated cash when included                                   |
| `goal-transfer`            | outflow           | flexible unless the user explicitly schedules/classifies it                                                                  | decreases spendable cash; increases goal tracking balance in its own module |
| `sinking-fund-reservation` | outflow           | flexible or required as explicitly selected                                                                                  | decreases spendable cash only when money is treated as reserved/unavailable |

The projection consumes only the cash side of an event. Goal/sinking-fund modules consume the allocation side. A shared event ID/link prevents counting the cash outflow twice.

### 6.2 Transfers and reservations

Initial V2 has no account-to-account event because consolidated cash would not change and multi-account semantics are deferred. Manually entered cash accounts establish the opening cash view only; moving money between them cannot create a normalized event in the initial contract.

A goal transfer or sinking-fund reservation affects available/spendable cash only after the user explicitly chooses that the allocation is set aside and unavailable for obligations. If a reservation is only a budget intention, it remains in the budget plan and is not emitted into cash flow. The normalization diagnostic records this distinction.

The future payment of a known periodic expense must not count both the reservation and the expense as consumption in the same metric. Reservation is a cash allocation; the later expense consumes reserved funds. Budget and net-worth views will need paired linkage, while consolidated spendable-cash flow includes each actual movement according to the selected reservation policy.

### 6.3 Status and provenance

- `expected` participates when included by policy.
- `actual` is historical/confirmed; an actual event on/after the opening balance date participates only if opening cash predates it.
- `cancelled` never affects calculations.
- Synthetic and user-entered events may be processed by identical engines but cannot share a workspace or overwrite each other silently.
- `label` is explanatory content only; it never selects a formula or classification.

## 7. Frozen attention classification

```ts
type AttentionLevel = "information" | "upcoming" | "attention" | "urgent";

type AttentionItem = Readonly<{
  id: string;
  conditionId: string;
  level: AttentionLevel;
  explanation: string;
  effectiveDate?: LocalDate;
  relatedEntityIds: readonly EntityId[];
  trace: Readonly<{
    inputRefs: readonly string[];
    calculatedValues: Readonly<Record<string, number | string | null>>;
    methodologyId: string;
  }>;
}>;
```

Levels are operational presentation groups, not judgments:

- `information`: factual context with no approaching entered date or modeled gap.
- `upcoming`: a required entered obligation/deadline is within a documented look-ahead window, with no projected coverage failure.
- `attention`: a modeled mismatch exists, such as an underfunded sinking fund, planned allocations above projected available cash, same-day timing uncertainty, or debt deadline extending beyond the entered date.
- `urgent`: only when a required obligation is due before projected available funds are sufficient to cover it, including an already overdue unpaid required event under the entered data. “Urgent” cannot be triggered by expense category, absolute amount, ratio threshold, or AI opinion.

Every condition has a registry entry defining exact inputs, predicate, level, message template, methodology, and non-trigger cases. Items sort by effective date, level order only as a deterministic secondary key, registry order, then ID. Dismissal is UI state and does not delete the underlying condition.

Prohibited output language includes “bad,” “dangerous,” “unhealthy,” “irresponsible,” “stupid,” and unsupported “cannot afford.” Acceptable output identifies amount, date, source condition, and assumptions.

1. `src/domain/money.ts`, `finance.ts`, `scenarios.ts`, `comparison.ts`, `schemas.ts`, and `types.ts` remain unchanged unless a separately documented genuine defect is approved.
2. V1 uses its existing `$1,000,000.00` per-field validation and rounding behavior; V2 limits do not alter it.
3. `finscope:baseline:v1` remains readable/writable by the existing storage module during compatibility.
4. Migration preserves the exact five V1 values and source; it adds no dated facts.
5. `/scenario`, `/build`, `/explore`, `/methodology`, and `/privacy` remain available. Existing scenario query parameters and methodology anchors remain protected.
6. The Scenario Lab remains the sole implementation of V1 housing, income, cost-of-living, and planned-savings scenarios and becomes Advanced Analysis.
7. A V2 workspace enters Advanced Analysis only through a visible `V1BaselineDerivation` naming period, included entity IDs, and assumptions.
8. Existing V1 unit, component, E2E, privacy, accessibility, route-refresh, and production-build tests remain release gates.

## 9. Contract-level unresolved questions

Approved product decisions are closed. These implementation choices remain for later phases and cannot alter the contracts above without a new ADR:

1. Audit exact dates and values for the four V2 synthetic personas in the fixture phase.
2. Freeze the traceable “Safe to use” formula in the approved cash-flow/budget phase.
3. Define any future account-specific liquidity or transfer semantics through a separate ADR; the initial engine remains consolidated.

None of these questions blocks completion of Phase 1. They are inputs to the next contract/implementation planning gate and do not authorize Phase 2.
