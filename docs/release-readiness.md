# Release readiness

## READY WITH MANUAL CHECKS

Automated verification found no release-blocking defect. NorthCents is suitable
for a public portfolio deployment, GitHub link, LinkedIn reference, recruiter
demonstration, and educational scenario use after the manual checks below are
completed for the intended release environment.

No release-blocking defects were identified by automated verification.

## Verified product limitations

- NorthCents models simplified monthly scenarios and does not predict future conditions.
- It provides analysis, not financial advice or affordability decisions.
- Demo profiles are synthetic and are not statistical averages.
- No live economic data, bank connection, authentication, analytics, or cloud persistence exists.
- Custom baselines are browser-local; scenario experiments are transient.

## Manual verification still required

- Real screen-reader announcements and navigation.
- Subjective visual review, including zoom and high-contrast preferences.
- Physical-device touch and virtual-keyboard behavior.
- Safari, Firefox, and Edge production smoke tests.
- Production-host HTTPS, security headers, logs, caching, metadata, and error pages.

This assessment is a release-quality engineering review, not a security audit,
penetration test, accessibility certification, or financial certification.
