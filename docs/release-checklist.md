| Screen readers            | MANUAL VERIFICATION REQUIRED | Test the primary flows with NVDA + Firefox/Chrome, VoiceOver + Safari, and TalkBack where supported. Confirm landmarks, labels, live-region timing, table navigation, and disclosure announcements. |
| Subjective visual quality | MANUAL VERIFICATION REQUIRED | Inspect all routes for typography, wrapping, overlap, focus visibility, and table scroll affordance at representative widths.                                                                       |
